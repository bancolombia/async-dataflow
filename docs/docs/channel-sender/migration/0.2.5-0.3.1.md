# 0.2.5 to 0.3.1

This update has the following changes:
- Dependency updates
- Traces and metrics supported in opentelemetry

So if you are using 0.2.5, you will need to update your configuration to include the new opentelemetry configuration options, and also update the image version in your deployment manifest to use 0.3.1.

```yaml
channel_sender_ex:
  prometheus_port: 9568
  opentelemetry:
    traces_enable: true # default to false
    traces_endpoint: "http://localhost:4318"
    traces_ignore_routes: ["/health", "/metrics"]
  metrics: # enabled by default
    active_interval_minutes_count: 2 # every 2 minutes the metrics will be updated with the count of active channels
```
