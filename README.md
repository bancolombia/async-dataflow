# Async DataFlow

The Async DataFlow component aims to deliver asynchronous responses in real time to client applications, thus enabling end-to-end asynchronois flows without losing the ability to respond in real time or eventually, send data to client applications as a result of asynchronous operations and oriented to `messages / commands / events` on the platform.

## Documentation

The documentation for this component is available in the [Async DataFlow Documentation Site](https://bancolombia.github.io/async-dataflow/).
