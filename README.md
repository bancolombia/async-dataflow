# Async DataFlow

The Async DataFlow component aims to deliver asynchronous responses in real time to client applications, thus enabling end-to-end asynchronois flows without losing the ability to respond in real time or eventually, send data to client applications as a result of asynchronous operations and oriented to `messages / commands / events` on the platform.

## Repository

- [Channel Sender](https://github.com/bancolombia/async-dataflow/tree/master/channel-sender) Distributed Elixir Cluster implementation of real time with websockets and notifications channels.
- [Client JS](https://github.com/bancolombia/async-dataflow/tree/master/clients/client-js) Javascript library for async data flow implementation for browsers.

- [Examples](https://github.com/bancolombia/async-dataflow/tree/master/examples)
  The purpose of this project is to help the community to understand more the the async data flow component to implement in full asyncio solutions.
